### third person bio

Balint is usually working on becoming a better person as well as a better sociologist at which point he can write a more earnest and productive bio. Until then, his pivotal accomplishment remains the recognition of desire for a cleaner subsistence.

### first person bio		

I am someone who believes others must also be heartbroken by war, violence, social inequality and ongoing ecological destruction. Someone who gets stuck inside his own head, imagining conversations. A male who imagines a world in which race, ethnicity, nationality, sex and/or gender is not held against anyone, a world in which humans can freely and openly define themselves regardless of social conventions. A world of tolerance, empathy, and fluid borders, unhitched by boundaries.  I want to feel something for the native plant, the unfashionable weed, the wild places from which we are gathered. I want to know how to think not what to think. I am suspicious of canned laughter, and petrified of canned hatred or canned discrimination or any feeling, habit or idea which comes pre-packaged for public consumption. I don't believe we are going to get away with any of this sh*t. I have no respect for the powerful given what one must sacrifice its sake. I don't believe in progress justified by bombs and missiles; progress in which we are just as likely to destroy the world as to improve it.  I am draw to strangers and faces worn true by sadness. Motivated by the hearts of those who lack power. I am distressed because of the perpetual haze of discontent fuelled by the change in consciousness unmatched by a change in habits or social conventions. I am engorged by products and feelings of consumertopia which mute the mind and stuff the mouth that would otherwise speak. I have taken the wrong roads passionately if only to discover that any road is a trap â€”  all roads being routes to destinations manufactured by others. I just want to meet you in the space we have invented. The one invisible for others.  I am dumb beyond my years and wise with childhood's unregrettings. I am a person you have seen gat stuck on the street, trying to imagine where to go next.
