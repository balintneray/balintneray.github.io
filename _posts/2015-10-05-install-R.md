### Installing R

Before you install R on your computer, the first thing to do is to check whether R is already installed (for example by an other user). In case it is already on your computer, you can check the latest version of R at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) (Comprehensive R Network) and compare it to those of already installed on your computer. New releases of R are made very regularly (approximately once a month), as R is actively being improved all the time. It is worthwhile installing new versions of R regularly, to make sure that you have a recent version of R (to ensure compatibility with all the latest versions of the R packages that you have downloaded).
<br><br>
These instructions will focus on installing R on a Windows PC. However if you're a Mac or Linux user and need help, just [let me know](http://www.cookbook-r.com).

#### Installing R on Windows

To install R on your Windows computer go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) again and keep clicking. If you need further help, follow these steps:

1. Click on "Download R 3.2.2 for Windows".
2. You may be asked if you want to save or run a file called something like “R-3.2.2-win.exe”.
3. Choose “Save” and save the file on the Desktop. Then double-click on the icon for the file to run it.
4. You will be asked what language to install it in - choose English.
5. The R Setup Wizard will appear in a window. Click “Next” at the bottom of the R Setup wizard window.
6. The next page says “Information” at the top. Click “Next” again.
7. The next page says “Select Destination Location” at the top. By default, it will suggest to install R in “C:\Program Files” on your computer.
8. Click “Next” at the bottom of the R Setup wizard window.
9. The next page says “Select components” at the top. Click “Next” again.
10. The next page says “Startup options” at the top. Click “Next” again.
11. The next page says “Select start menu folder” at the top. Click “Next” again.
12. The next page says “Select additional tasks” at the top. Click “Next” again.
13. R should now be installed. This will take about a minute. When R has finished, you will see “Completing the R for Windows Setup Wizard” appear. Click “Finish”.
14. Check if there is an “R” icon on the desktop of the computer that you are using. If so, double-click on the “R” icon to start R.
15. If you cannot find an “R” icon, click on the “Start” button at the bottom left of your computer screen, and then choose “All programs”, and start R by selecting “R” from the menu of programs. The R console should pop up.
16. You can close the program, you won't really use it.

### Installing RStudio (GUI) on Windows

RStudio is easy to use, it has a decent help page, it has very good support, and it incorporates R in a practical way. Of course, you’re free to work with any other GUI you like.
<br><br>
Installing RStudio is easy. Just follow these steps:

1. Go to [RStudio Download](https://www.rstudio.com/ide/download).
2. Click the Download RStudio Desktop button.
3. Select the installation file for your system.
4. Run the installation file.

RStudio will be installed on your system. It normally detects your latest installed R version automatically. If you didn’t do anything funky, you should be able to use R from within RStudio without extra configuration.

### Get a text editor software too

A good text editor software can make you're life a lot easier when you've got a bunch of code to deal with. If you don't have a favorite yet, I would suggest you to go with [Atom](https://atom.io). But there are other good ones out there, like: [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com).
